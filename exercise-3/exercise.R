Employee 93

# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?

Employee 57

# What was the average salary increase?

### Bonus ###

# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory


# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?


# Is that what you expected them to lose?

### Double Bonus (no answer given) ###

# Repeat the above experiment 100 times, tracking the loss each time.
# Does the average loss equal what you expect?
# What about 10,000 times?
